## Digital envelopes

Digital Envelopes is a small app for budgeting, mimicking the 'envelope' method of personal finance management.

#### Development Specs

Ruby version 3.2.2

Tested using Safari Version 16.5.1

RDBMS: postgreSQL Version 14.8

#### Installation

1. Create a psql database called `budget`. Import `schema.sql` will create the required schema and populate the database with test data.
2. Run `ruby budget.rb` to start the web server.
3. Navigate to `localhost:4567` (or whatever port your application is listening on).

#### A bit on the 'Envelope' system of personal finance

This app is meant to create a digital version of the envelope system. In the physical world, a budgeteer would use real envelopes, and label each envelope with an expense category. This could be rent, groceries, insurance, fun money, or anything else. Then, anytime they are paid income, they would allocate their cash into those envelopes. Then, any time a purchase or expense comes up, it would be paid from the appropriate envelope.

The key focus of this method is to prevent overspending for any given category; if the cash hasn't been allocated for a purchase, then the envelope is empty. To complete the purchase, then money would need to either be pulled from another category, or not completed. This allows the person to be mindful and have greater awareness around spending.

#### Usage

The app requires the user to be logged in to access any portion of the app. Once logged in, the user will remain logged in until the `Sign Out` button is pressed.

1. The **budget** page
   - The main budget page is where you have an overview of your entire budget. 
   - At the top of the page, the amount of money awaiting **'To Be Assigned'** to a category is shown. This is the difference between all inflow transactions and the total amount assigned to each category. This assignment can be thought of as placing cash into an envelope.
   - **<u>The main goal of this app</u>** is to keep the **'To Be Assigned'** amount at 0. If this number is positive, that means there is money unassigned and needs to be placed into a category. If this number is negative, that means that the user has assigned more money than they really have. While this is allowed by the app, it is intended only to allow the user to temporarily over assign money while moving money between categories.
   - To assign money to a category, enter an amount into the appropriate box and press the **Reassign** button.
   - Next, you can see all of your categories, how much money you have assigned to each category, and how much you have remaining to spend from that category. **Assigned** is how much cash you originally placed into the 'envelope'. **Remaining** is how much money is still in the 'envelope', ready to be spent.
   - Below categories is a view of all **accounts**. The current balance of each is also shown.
